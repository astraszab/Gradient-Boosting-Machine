# Gradient-Boosting-Machine
Implementation of Gradient Boosting for regression and classification

Algorithms were implemented according to a paper by Jerome H. Friedman "Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine" https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/trebst.pdf

Algorithms are:
- LS_Boost, optimizing MSE
- L2_TreeBoost, optimizing binary cross-entropy
